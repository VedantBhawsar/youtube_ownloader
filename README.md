## Title:

### Simple Youtube Playlist Downloader (Bash Script)

## Description:

This release introduces a new bash script, test_download_playlist.sh, that allows you to easily download Youtube playlists in your desired quality.

## Features:

1. Download Youtube playlists with a single command.
2. Specify the desired video quality (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p).
3. Leverages a Python script (download_playlist.py) for the actual download process.
4. Provides user feedback on download success or failure.

## How to Use:

1. Download this release. (GitHub offers a "Download ZIP" button for releases)
2. Extract the downloaded file. This will typically create a folder containing the script and potentially other files (like the Python script).
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script (test_download_playlist.sh). You can use the cd command in the terminal to navigate.
5. Run the script with the playlist URL and desired quality as arguments. Here's an example command:
   ```bash
      ./youtube_download.sh 


## Important Notes:

Downloading from Youtube might violate their terms of service. Make sure you only download videos you have permission to download.
This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your system. You can check by running python3 --version in your terminal.
